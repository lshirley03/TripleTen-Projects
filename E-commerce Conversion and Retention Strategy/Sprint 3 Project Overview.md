# Triple Ten Sprint 3 Project

# E-Commerce Conversion and Retention

## Project Overview
This project utilized Conversion Funnel and Cohort Analysis on raw transaction logs to diagnose user website behavior. The goal was to pinpoint major drop-off points, quantify customer loss, and provide actionable recommendations to increase conversions and long-term retention.


## Key Findings
Conversion Failure: The funnel analysis showed that only 10.34% of 10,459 users completed a purchase, with the "viewer" stage identified as the critical drop-off point.

Retention Crisis: Cohort analysis proved the vast majority of new users are lost in the first month, highlighting a failure in initial user experience.

Actionable Strategy: Recommended improving website user-friendliness (primary focus) and launching targeted messaging/referral programs (secondary strategies) to curb customer loss.
